Good morning, Ironhackers, @channel
Hope you all had an amazing Module 0 week, and if it’s harder than you expected, don’t panic please - it’s just the beginning, and trust yourself and the reasons why you’re here:blush:
:pray:I’d like to ask you to please fill out this survey by today.
It’s super essential for us to get to know you a bit before the bootcamp starts so we can adapt the class and support you as much as possible, given the methodology and pace of the bootcamp. Also, we have a small class so it would be more personalised.
Thank you for your collaboration and hope you all have a good day.

Module 0 has almost finished which means, Monday is your official first day! :female-astronaut: :rocket:
Day :one:: You all have received your invite for next Monday at 9:00, but you can also find it here (and pinned) the link for that day and the entire bootcamp from now on. We will start on Monday with a short presentation where I’ll be explaining guidelines, tips, and expectations + you’ll also meet the career services. Then, you’ll start your official first day of class with your Lead teacher 
@Mat
 :raised_hands:.
Have a great weekend and good luck with your assessments, and please, don’t panic if you don’t understand something, you’re here to learn :computer:

Good morning Ironhackers, @channel
The first week is almost done :rocket: and I hope you had a great one!!
:writing_hand:As I explained in the Day 1 presentation, every Friday (at 12pm) you will need to complete a survey in your student portal telling us how the week was for you, how well-supported you were, any feedback you would like to comment on…this is your space to share your emotions and thoughts. 
@Mat
 will give you a couple of minutes during the day to complete it.
:white_heart:I’ll be the one who reviews the survey every week to see how’s everything going and if we can take action on any of your feedback.
As you may already know, if anything you can also reach out to me for 1:1 here, but also I’ll be the one to ask you for those meetings to get to you a bit better, and to ask you about your experience so far.
Having said that, enjoy this weekend, you deserve it, and thanks for your collaboration!

:cinema: Hey team, I would like to take the opportunity to talk about having camera on during classes:
:people_hugging: Since we’re remote, it’s super easy to get distracted, especially if you have the camera off. It’s also beneficial for the teaching team + staff to be able to read your face and expressions in order to help you when you have doubts during the class, but also to build positive, natural, and real communication even though we’re online. This goes not only for the Ironhack team but also for your classmates.
:star2: We aim to replicate the bootcamp experience as a professional environment because after the bootcamp, you’ll be ready to start working in a company, so here is the place to start with that foundation.
:blue_heart:There will be moments when you need to turn the camera off for any specific reason, and that’s fine. But please, don’t make it a habit. The habit should be to turn your camera on.
Let’s try to create a healthy, positive, and real environment, we’re the generation of digital nomads and our communication can be just as effective as if we were working in the same room (or even better!).
Thank you so much for your collaboration, team.
